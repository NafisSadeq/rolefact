# RoleFact

Code for EMNLP 2024 findings paper: [Mitigating Hallucination in Fictional Character Role-Play](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17260).  In this work, we focus on the evaluation and mitigation of hallucination in fictional character role-play. We introduce the Script Grounded Roleplay (SGR) dataset with more than 2,000 characters and 72,000 interviews, including 18,000 adversarial questions. We propose RoleFact, a role-playing method that mitigates hallucination by modulating the influence of parametric knowledge using a pre-calibrated confidence threshold.
